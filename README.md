## Abstract
Cats Meow is a cat fact generator. The user is able to generate random cat facts at the click of a button, favorite the fact to save for later or get a new fact. This application is designed for all those people out there desperate to know the most about cats and more specifically, to be able to impress their friends with their super knowledge of everyones favorite furry companions..... well at least 25% of us. 

## Context
The purpose of this application is to fetch data from an api and manipulate it in some way through user interaction all while displaying an understanding of React architecture and routing with React Router.

## Winns
Updating the api from which the application is fetching its data. This new data source, [The Cat API](https://thecatapi.com/) delivers a larger and more complex object upon request which the application cleans up before rendering the final data to the DOM.

## Challenges
Reformattig the application to handle the new Cat API took a fair amount of work and basically led to a complete overhaul of the project.
